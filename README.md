# FlAEsh
FlAEsh is basically a very low cost and very low tech beamer. It uses a photoflash as its light source. It can be used in combination with cameras to overlay the image with whatever content you want to project. Or it can be used as a somewhat different 'strobe projector' to project text or bitmap images or animations (one frame per flash).

Here you will find some code to run the display (text, bitmap images), drawings to make breakout-boards for the 0.6mm spaced connectors of the Nokia display, .stl-file of the 3D-printable adapter for a Cannon Speedlite 430 flash and a voltage controller to power your flash via 6-15V power-supply (use at your own risk!).

It features a Microduino, a very low-cost (50cents-3$) Nokia 1202 lcd display and can optionally be fitted with a bluetooth or wifi chip.

The idea to use a photo flash as a light source to project images has been around for a long time and has been used mostly for studio photography. Here are some sources of inspiration:
