# FlAEsh
FlAEsh is basically a very low cost and very low tech beamer. It uses a photoflash as its light source. It can be used in combination with cameras to overlay the image with whatever content you want to project. Or it can be used as a somewhat different 'strobe projector' to project text or bitmap images or animations (one frame per flash).

It features a Microduino, a very low-cost (50cents-3$) Nokia 1202 lcd display and can optionally be fitted with a bluetooth or wifi chip.

The idea to use a photo flash as a light source to project images has been around for a long time and has been used mostly for studio photography. Here are some sources of inspiration:

Here you will find some Code to run the display and drawings to produce breakout-boards for the 0.6mm spaced connectors.
